            <h2>ðŸ§ª Welcome to the Natural Dye Lab ðŸŒ±</h2>
            <p>
                For thousands of years, people around the world have used natural materials â€” like roots, leaves, bark, and even insects â€” to dye textiles.
                This site is a digital recreation of that process: a space where you can experiment with combining natural materials and mordants to simulate the outcomes of dyeing.
            </p>

            <h3>How natural dyes work</h3>
            <ul>
                Dye materials contain pigments â€” molecules that absorb and reflect certain wavelengths of light, giving them color. 
                Mordants are mineral salts (like alum, copper, or iron) that bond with both the pigment and the fiber. They act as a bridge, helping the dye adhere to the fabric â€” and they often <em>shift the color</em> in dramatic ways.
            </ul>
            <p>
                The same dye material can produce completely different hues depending on the mordant used. For example, madder root might give you a soft coral pink with alum, but a deep brick red with iron.
            </p>

            <ol>
                In the dye lab, select a dye material and a mordant from the dropdown lists, and create a new natural dye!
            </ol>
